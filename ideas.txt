Here's a list of some ideas for things you could add to your language:

- Add support for an if statement.
  (if (= 1 1)
    "Yep"
    "Nope") 

- Add support for < and >
  (if (< 1 2)
    "Yep"
    "Nope")

  (if (> 1 2)
    "Yep"
    "Nope")

- Add support for defining values
  (def name "Bernie")
  (if (= name "Bernie")
    "Yep"
    "Nope")

- Add support for running multiple statements
  (do
    (thing1)
    (thing2))

- Add support for local variables
  (let [x 1
        y 2]
   (+ x y))

- Add support for defining functions
  (def printer (fn [arg1] (println arg1))
  (printer "Yo!")
   
- Add support for simple math
  (= (* 1 2) (+ 1 1) (/ 4 2) (- 4 2))
  (= (+ 1 1 1) 3)    
    
- Add support for looping
  (loop [n 1]
    (if (< n 4)
      (recur (+ n 1))
      (println "Final count!" n)))
      
- Add support for maps
  (def map {"one" 1 "two" 2})
  (= 1 (get map "one"))
    
- Add support for loading a package into the current environment
  (use org.example.Functions)
  (example-hello "Hi")

- Add support for throwing and catching exceptions
  (try
    (throw "Hi")
    (catch ex
      (println "Caught an exception: " ex)))
